# Composites
Failure analysis of Fiber Reinforced Composite(FRC) laminate.
8 Plies are stacked on top of each other at different angles.
The plies are considered as Orthotropic.
Calculations are done with E, G, nu, alpha, beta given for different directions.
All expressions are taken from a standard reference book.
Using strength ratio criterion checking which plies have failed and then making the failed properties as zero we continue to do the analysis till all the plies.
So at the last we get a failure strength.
